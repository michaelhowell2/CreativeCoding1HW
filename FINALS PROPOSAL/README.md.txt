For my finals, I would like to attempt a work of generative art.


 I've been looking around for ideas. I thought of doing one like this

I also thought of doing a lava lamp.

but I think I settled on

 but "more" and have it change multiple times using various colors. I want to add music, which I had trouble with, but I found out I needed to add a start button of sorts to allow it to play, as Chrome hates autoplay, I guess... so I'm going to create particles on Canvas to look like this...

but with tendrils and several variations of color. The particles will keep going like abstract art. I've downloaded a few songs from Pixabay to implement this as a relaxing screensaver, I guess.


I have already spent countless hours this week learning how to add sound, learning about particles and vectors, and all that stuff. Finally, I am at a point where I start building code. I took a couple of days off my full-time job to hammer some of this out.

I don't think I'll need to learn any new tech just need to learn coding better in p5j.It is starting to click a little bit for me.

I've been watching several videos, in particular from this guy,

I have been learning about sound and implementing it this week. Also learned how to troubleshoot errors in Visual Code Studio.

  Most of this week I've been researching and playing. I will work on most of the coding on Friday 4/25 and over the weekend
