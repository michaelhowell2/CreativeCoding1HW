    When it comes to learning something new, I believe that learning styles have little effect on the person learning the material. I took the learning style quiz, and it shows that I am an auditory learner with a mix of auditory, visual, and tactile skills in a close division between them all. Personally, I do better just to sit and hear the information. I seem to absorb it more, but I also must look at things visually and physically and do them as well, depending on the tasks at hand. If I'm assembling something like a cabinet or chair, I need visual pictures showing me how to put them together rather than somebody telling me how to do them. But when it comes to lectures and programs, I do very well at remembering the information that is provided to me.

     I am currently a wastewater operator, where there are a lot of mechanical pieces of equipment. Some of that equipment does not have written pictures or auditory information to show me how to do the repair. I must have somebody show me how to do it, or I must do it myself or by going in there, taking it apart, and hoping to remember how to do it. When that happens, I take photos step by step, taking things apart so I can put them back together exactly how they came apart. 

      I'm only speaking for myself here, but what I need may be different from what others need. I need a combination of all the different learning styles to learn new things and retain the information I believe each person is different, and their preferred learning style is stronger in one aspect than another, but they probably use all the different styles as well, they're just stronger in that other areas then I would be, and I would be stronger in some of the other learning styles than they are.
