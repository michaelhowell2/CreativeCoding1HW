    From my brief experience playing around with GUI and CLI, I have noticed a few differences, which still lead to the same outcome. For example, GUI is a visual experience; you interact with a mouse and keyboard to attain the required result. GUI seems simpler in comparison to CLI, which uses commands from a keyboard. There are no visual cues with CLI. In GUI, the user can change the appearance, while in CLI, the user cannot, except for words and symbols. 

     I also noticed that when I made CLI mistakes, I switched to my GUI to see if my commands worked. Mistakes in CLI may not be as noticeable as they are in GUI. I can instantly see my mistakes in GUI. I am also able to find my documents more easily using GUI. Iâ€˜m sure if I experiment more, I can learn to use DIR to find my files using CLI. I assume that for the amateur or layman such as myself, the GUI would be sufficient, but once learned, CLI could provide faster and more powerful tools for the user to complete certain tasks. These are the differences I noticed playing around with CLI vs. GUI for the first time.
